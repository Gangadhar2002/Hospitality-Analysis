# Hospitality-Analysis

This project presents a Hospitality Analytics Dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze hotel performance across multiple cities. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, occupancy, booking trends, cancellations, and customer behavior. With interactive filters and weekly performance tracking, it helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and maximize revenue.
# Problems
The hospitality industry faces challenges in consolidating and analyzing performance data across multiple hotels and cities. Key issues include limited visibility into revenue streams, occupancy levels, booking trends, and cancellations, which makes it difficult for stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, compare weekday vs. weekend performance, and track essential KPIs such as ADR, RevPAR, and occupancy %. Without a centralized and interactive reporting system, decision-making becomes inefficient and reactive.
# Key inside
1)Total Revenue of around 1.7B was generated, with an average occupancy rate of 57.8%.

2)Weekdays contributed higher revenue (1070M) compared to weekends (639M), showing business-heavy demand.

3)Checked-out bookings (94K) dominate, but there are still 33K cancellations and 7K no-shows, impacting revenue.

4)Elite and Premium rooms generated the highest revenue share, together contributing more than 60% of total revenue.
# Conclusion
The Hospitality Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hotel performance by consolidating revenue, occupancy, and booking data across multiple cities. The insights highlight that weekdays drive higher revenue, while cancellations and no-shows significantly affect overall earnings. Room categories like Elite and Premium contribute the most to revenue, guiding hotels to focus on these segments. This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making, helping businesses improve efficiency, reduce revenue leakages, and maximize growth opportunities.
